NOTE: I reused my Assignment 1 HTML code, however, I modified the CSS code it contained where applicable. 

Div classes:
sidebar, widget, classes that pertain to the body of my text (i.e. careers, aspirations). 

I used these classes to improve the readability of my code and to not restate customizations multiple times.
